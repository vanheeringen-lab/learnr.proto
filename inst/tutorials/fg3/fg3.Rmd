## 3.1 Introduction   
In week 2 we quantified and visualized the overlap between histone peaks and promoters and examined the association with gene expression. Although informative, we have been ignoring the actual ChIP-seq signal strengths altogether.  
<br>
This week you will investigate the relationship between histone PTMs and gene expression further by including ChIP-seq signals in your analyses. You will generate plots displaying the distribution of ChIP-seq signal around certain genomic positions, here a set of promoter regions to answer common questions like: "*What is the signal of the mark around the TSS?*", "*What is the relationship between histone ChIP-seq signal intensity and gene expression?*".  
<br>
These plots include an average signal profile and a heatmap representation. You could use dplyr-related functions and ggplot-ting to achieve this but it is much more convenient to use dedicated tools for these tasks.   
<br>
We have chosen for the [genomation](https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/genomation) package for this purpose because it is compatible with the file types that we have available. (Side note: there are a number of other packages to analyze ChIP-seq data we well. Incl. ChIPpeakAnno and ChIPseeker.)   
<br>
We have installed and loaded this package for you with the following code:  
```{r install_genomation, echo = T, eval =FALSE}
BiocManager::install("genomation")
library(genomation)
```

### Tutorial specs  
The exercises in this tutorial are similar to those in fg2. A brief reminder:  

- For some longer coding exercises, we left blanks as '\_\_\_' that indicate where in the code you should fill in a function, object or variable. Make sure you **fill out all the blanks before hitting 'Run Code' or 'Submit Answer'**. If you leave even a single '\_', this will result in errors that may be difficult to interpret.  
- Hit `Hint` (when provided) for clues. Due to technical reasons **you can't always go back to previous hints so make sure you read them well!**       
- Hit `Run Code` to test your code and preview the output (but make sure no '\_' are left).  
- Hit `Submit Answer` (if present) to submit the code (make sure no '\_' are left) for evaluation.    
- For some complete-the-code exercises, automated code-checking is enabled. You can recognize these exercises by the addition of '(code check)' to the exercise. In these cases, R will give custom feedback that helps you correct your code.  
- Try to keep yourself from hitting `Solution` (when provided). This is option is provided for '(code check)' exercises. Only use it when you do not understand the automatic feedback given by R.   
- Hit `Start Over` to remove any adjustments you made and start again.   

Although we ask for specific answers or completion of specific code, you are encouraged to test your own code and use `Run Code` and `Start Over`. I.e., remove the pre-coded code and write your own code for a different graph or different summary of the data. Use `Run Code` to preview the results. Unfortunately these self-thought of codes can not be evaluated. For the evaluation you need to use our pre-coded code. Hit `Start Over` to get this pre-coded code.

### 3.1.1 Learning Objectives  

> At the end of week 3 you are able to:  
> 
1. Identify the nearest TSS to a histone ChIP-seq peak.  
3. Plot the distribution of distances between ChIP-seq peaks and the nearest TSS.      
2. Import coverage data from bigWig files into r.  
4. Plot the average histone ChIP-seq signal around a genomic feature like the TSS.  
5. Plot the relationship between the average ChIP-seq signal at the TSS and gene expression.   
6. Plot ChIP-seq signal around a genomic feature in a heatmap figure.  
7. Order the heatmap of (6) by gene expression.  
8. Cluster the heatmap of (6) based on ChIP-seq signals of different marks.  
9. Annotate the clusters identified in a ChromHMM heatmap based on histone PTM ChIP-seq data.   
  
## 3.2 Identify nearby TSSs  
### 3.2.1 Identify the nearest TSS   
First, let's identify the nearest TSS and plot the distance between a histone mark and its nearest TSS (in contrast to identifying strict overlap as in **fg2**).  

### Exercise 1    
Identify the nearest TSS for each H3K4me3 peak in monocytes.   

> **Exercise 1a**: Recap, which of the commands below imports the peaks table into a GRanges object?  

```{r q1_mc_import}
question("Which function imports the H3K4me3 peaks into a GRanges object?",
         answer("import(\"h3k4me3_peaks.chr19.bed\", format = \"narrowPeak\")", correct =TRUE),
         answer("import(\"h3k4me3_peaks.chr19.bed\", format = \"BED\")", message = "BED is not the right format."),
         answer("import(\"h3k4me3_peaks.chr19.bed\", format = \"broadPeak\")", message = "check the file format."),
         answer("read.table(\"h3k4me3_peaks.chr19.bed\", format = \"broadPeak\")", message = "read.table parses the data into a data.frame while we asked for a GRanges object."),
         allow_retry =TRUE,
         random_answer_order =TRUE)
```

### Exercise 1b  
To identify the nearest TSS, you use the `distance2NearestFeature()` function:   

```{r nearestfeature_example, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
distance2NearestFeature(g.idh = [chip_peaks_in_GRanges], 
                        tss = [TSSs_in_GRanges])  
```

> **Exercise 1b**: Identify the nearest TSS for each H3K4me3 ChIP-seq peak.  
> 
- H3K4me3 peaks in monocytes are stored in `monocytes_h3k4me3`.   
- TSS locations are stored in object `tss_chr19`.  
- Print the first five rows of the resulting object using `head()`.     

```{r q1_distancetss, exercise =TRUE, exercise.lines = 5, exercise.eval =FALSE, error = TRUE}
# 1. Identify the nearest TSS for each H3K4me3 peak  
dist_h3k4me3_to_tss <- __(g.idh = __, tss = __)

# 2. Print the first five lines of 'dist_h3k4me3_to_tss' with head()

```

```{r q1_distancetss-hint-1}
# use the function
distance2NearestFeature()
```

```{r q1_distancetss-hint-2}
# within distance2NearestFeature define g.idh as:
g.idh = monocytes_h3k4me3
```

```{r q1_distancetss-hint-3}
# and tss as:
tss = tss_chr19
```

```{r q1_distancetss-hint-4}
# finish with
head(dist_h3k4me3_to_tss)
```

```{r q1_distancetss-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~identical(.result, head(distance2NearestFeature(monocytes_h3k4me3, tss_chr19)))),
  correct = "This object, 'dist_h3k4me3_to_tss' is a data.frame reporting for each H3K4me3 peak its nearest TSS, the name (Entrez geneid) of the corresponding gene, and the distance between them. Which variable reports the distance?"
)
```

* **Important to note1**: there are negative and positive distances reported in `dist_h3k4me3_to_tss$dist.to.feature`. Negative values indicate that the H3K4me3 peak is located **upstream** the TSS, positive values refer to H3K4me3 peaks located **downstream** the TSS.   
* **Important to note2**: The fact that the output is a data.frame makes it easy for us to manipulate the data with dplyr and plot the results ggplot2.    

<br>

>#### **Optional check**:  
<details><summary>Curious to check the matches in the genome browser? Click here for a quick how-to:</summary>   
<br>
You may want to check some of the matches. For example to check that positive distances are indeed peaks that are located *downstream* the TSS. To do so...  
> 
1. View a part of the output of `dist_h3k4me3_to_tss`. For example, peaks with `dist.to.feature` above 1kb, sorted by distance, showing only the top 5 of the output by running: `dist_h3k4me3_to_tss %>% filter(dist.to.feature >= 1000) %>% arrange(dist.to.feature) %>% slice_head(n=5)`   
2. The first row reports:     
  `r distance2NearestFeature(monocytes_h3k4me3, tss_chr19) %>% filter(dist.to.feature >= 1000) %>% arrange(dist.to.feature) %>% slice_head(n=2) %>% slice_tail(n=1)`  
3. You can either look up the gene id ('feature.name' variable) in the [ncbi gene database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/) and use the gene symbol to navigate to the right location in the UCSC genome browser.  
3. Or subset `monocytes_h3k4me3` with the given index in the 'target.index' column (805): `monocytes_h3k4me3[805]`.  
4. Go to the UCSC Genome Browser.  
5. Upload the monocytes trackhub (same as fg1): `http://mbdata.science.ru.nl/ctoenhake/edu/trackhub_monocytes/hub.txt`.    
    + Go to the tab "My Data" in the top menu.  
    + Select "Track Hubs".   
    + In the "My hubs" tab you can paste the above URL.  
    + You need to change the visibility of the tracks with "monocyte_H3K4me3_peaks" from "hide" to "pack". This can be done below the browser view. Remember to hit `Refresh`.  
6. Navigate to the gene from step 3 or the genomic region of step 4.  
    + In this example: `chr19:11577771-11577970`.    
7. Zoom out and observe or measure the location of the peak in relation to the TSS of the gene given in step 3. The name of the peak is given in the output of step 4.   
8. This confirms that **positive dist.to.feature values indicate that the H3K4me3 peaks is located *downstream* the TSS**.  
</details>  

### 3.2.2 Plot distances between ChIP peaks and features  
Let's plot the reported distances between H3K4me3 peaks and their nearest TSS!   

### Exercise 2   

> **Exercise 2a:** Print a summary of the distances reported in `dist_h3k4me3_to_tss` using the `summary()` function.
> 
> * Tip: Look at the output of exercise 1b to identify the variable that stores the distances.   

```{r prepare_q2a, echo =FALSE}
 dist_h3k4me3_to_tss <- distance2NearestFeature(monocytes_h3k4me3, tss_chr19)
```

```{r q2a_summary, exercise =TRUE, exercise.eval =FALSE, error = T, exercise.setup = "prepare_q2a"}
# print a summary of the distances

```

```{r q2a_summary-hint-1}
# We want a summary of 
dist_h3k4me3_to_tss$dist.to.feature
```

```{r q2a_summary-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~identical(.result,summary(dist_h3k4me3_to_tss$dist.to.feature))),
  correct = "Examine the reported values, within what range of the TSS are 50% of the peaks located (1st Quartile - 3rd Quartile)?"
)
```

### Exercise 2b  

> **Exercise 2b:** Plot the distances from `dist_h3k4me3_to_tss` using ggplot() and geom_histogram().  
>
> * In geom_histogram() observe the effect of setting the parameter `binwidth=` to 1kb, 10kb and 100kb.  
> * Run the code and answer the multiple-choice question below.     

>#### **Refresher**: histograms   
<details><summary>Click here for a quick explainer on histograms and the importance of the **binwidth**.</summary>   
**Histograms** visualize the distribution of a single variable. Events are grouped into bins with comparable values and the number of events per bin is counted and these counts are visualized.  
<br>
Because histograms are made by binning the data, the bin width is a critical parameter that will affect the appearance of the graph. Choosing a bin width that is too small will result in a overly busy and peaky histogram making it difficult to discern the main trends. If the bin width is too large, then smaller features of the distribution may dissapear.  
<br>
In practice, if you generate a histogram, always explore multiple bin widths besides the default settings.   
<br>
In geom_histogram(), the bin width can be set by:  
> 
- Specify the parameter "binwidth", eg `binwidth = 5`   
- Specify the parameter "breaks", eg `breaks=seq(20, 50, by=2)` or `breaks=c(0,100,200)`  
</details>  

```{r q2b_plotdistances, exercise =TRUE, exercise.eval =FALSE, error = T, exercise.setup = "prepare_q2a"}
# plot the distances reported in 'dist_h3k4me3_to_tss' as histogram with ggplot
# try binwidth of 1000, 10000 and 100000.   
ggplot(___)+
  geom_histogram(aes(x= ___), binwidth = __)
```

```{r q2b_plotdistances-hint-1}
# use the output from exercise 1b as the input for ggplot
```

```{r q2b_plotdistances-hint-2}
# plot the distance on the x axis
```

```{r q2b_plotdistances-hint-3}
# ie 
ggplot(dist_h3k4me3_to_tss)+
  geom_histogram(aes(x=dist.to.feature))
```

```{r q2b_plotdistances-hint-4}
# with binwidth=10000 (for 10kb)
ggplot(dist_h3k4me3_to_tss)+
  geom_histogram(aes(x=dist.to.feature), binwidth = 10000)
```

```{r q2b_plotdistances_mc}
question("Which of the following statments are correct? Tip: you can also use the output of summary() of exercise 2a." ,
         answer("Over 50% of the datapoints fall within 10kb up- or downstream the TSS", correct = T, message = "Indeed, over 50% of H3K4me3 peaks are within +/- 10kb of the TSS. But also notice the  outliers: some peaks are assigned to TSSs that are over 100kb away! Although H3K4me3 is generally enriched at promoters, it thus also found further away from the promoter. These 'distant' H3K4me3 peaks may be truely H3K4me3 enriched sites but may also be H3K4me1 peaks in enhancers that are detected in this ChIP due to cross-reactivity of the H3K4me3 antibody. Alterantively, through chromosomal looping between enhancer and promoter, these regions might be co-immunoprecipitated with the H3K4me3 ChIP."),
         answer("Less than 50% of the datapoints fall within 10kb up- or downstream the TSS", message= "Review the output of question 2a. Take a carefull look at the 1st and 3rd Quartile values."),
         answer("A binwidth of 100kb, givs us the nicest histogram with sufficient detail but not too peaky.", message = "Try again, 100kb is a bit too large in this case."),
         answer("A binwidth of 10kb, givs us the nicest histogram with sufficient detail but not too peaky.", correct=TRUE),
         allow_retry=TRUE
         )
```

> #### **Optional exercise**:  
<details><summary>Want to plot the distance to the nearest TSS for other marks?... (click here) :</summary>   
>  
* In the chunk of exercise 2b, add a line of code with the function:    
        `my_test <- distance2NearestFeature(g.idh = [GRanges_object], tss = tss_chr19)`.    
* The peaks of the other histone marks in our dataset are stored in GRanges objects:    
        `monocytes_h3k4me1`, `monocytes_h3k27ac`, `monocytes_h3k27me3`, `monocytes_h3k9me3` or `monocytes_h3k36me3`.   
* Then, plot the histogram with:    
        `ggplot(my_test)+`  
            `geom_histogram(aes(x=dist.to.feature), binwidth = 10000)`  
</details>  

## 3.3 ChIP-seq signal strength   
### 3.3.1 ChIP-seq signal introduction  
Distance and overlap may tell you which gene the mark is most likely associated with. For example, in fg2 we observed that the presence and absence of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 at a gene's promoter are associated with its level of gene expression. But there is more to it!  
<br>
Not only the presence or absence but the actual signal from ChIP-seq marks can be associated with the expression level of the gene in question. Such associations between ChIP-seq signal strength and gene expression - being it positive or negative associations - point to a functional relationship. Think of the histone PTM recruiting basal transcription factors thereby promoting transcription (as is the case for H3K4me3) or - the other way around - the placing of marks by proteins recruited to the transcriptional machinery in elongation mode (as is the case for H3K36me3).  
<br>
In both cases you will observe a positive association between ChIP-seq signal strength and gene expression. In research, such observations (or the absence thereof) provide valuable insights in the function of a mark and can help you design follow-up experiments.   
<br>
Let's look at these relationships in real data.   

### 3.3.2 Importing ChIP-seq signal in r   
ChIP-seq signal can be obtained from BAM files or bigWig files. Remember from week 1, BAM files contain records of read alignments with 1 line per read. The bigWig files do not store individual reads but the coverage across the genome, often normalized per million mapped reads.   
<br>
Not all packages and functions are compatible with both file types and the resulting plots may look slightly different in part because BAM files - as they store read information -  give you more freedom to define how coverage is calculated. You will use the data from bigWig files today as those are provided by BLUEPRINT in contrast to BAM files.     
<!-- REF: https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/genomation/inst/doc/GenomationManual.html#4_Extraction_and_visualization_of_genomic_data   -->
<br>
We limited the data stored in the bigWig files to a **10kb window around the TSSs of 40% of genes on chromosome 19 (genes were randomly selected)**. This was done to reduce the size of these files (bigWig and BAM files are huge!) and speed up the tutorial a bit. By taking a *random* selection, the relationships present in the genome-wide dataset should till hold in the sampled dataset. However, because of this decision you can't make plots of windows wider than 10kb. Also, even with this downsampling, the files are relatively large and it may take a bit more time to run the code compared to the codes you ran in fg2 (10-20sec). So- more time for coffee ;-)!  


### Exercise 3  
You will plot the average H3K4me3 ChIP-seq signal strength around the TSS.  

A trick that prevents loading complete bigWig files in your environment is to load only the the regions of interest; in this case the window around the TSS. You load the signal into r with the `ScoreMatrix()` function from the genomation package:  

```{r scorematrixcode, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ScoreMatrix(target = [path_to_bigWig_file], 
            windows = [GRanges_object_with_windows_of_interest],  # 'windows' can also be called 'intervals' or 'regions'
            type = "bigWig", 
            strand.aware = [TRUE/FALSE], 
            ...)
```

* To take the strand of the TSS into account, we set `strand.aware=TRUE`.   
* Every row in the resulting ScoreMatrix object corresponds to a window of the `[GRanges_object_with_intervals_of_interest]`.  
* Every column in the resulting ScoreMatrix object is a bp within that window (see the image below).   
* `...` means that there are additional, optional arguments, some of which we will come back to later on in the tutorial.  

  ![ScoreMatrix visual](images/genomation_scorematrix.png){width=50%}\   
  *Modified from the [Genomation vignette](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/genomation/inst/doc/GenomationManual.html#1_Introduction): "genomation: a toolkit for annotation and visualization of genomic data", version 2020-10-27.*

<br>   
The GRanges object `tss_chr19_sample` contains the TSSs (1bp) of which we also have data in the bigWig files. The window is currently 1bp but we want to plot the signal *around* the TSS. You thus need to resize these 1bp intervals to the window that you are interested in. You can achieve this with the `resize()` function from the GenomicRanges package:  

```{r resizexcode, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
resize(x = [GRanges_object], width = [desired_width], fix = ["start", "end" or "center"])
```

* If we want a window of 20kb around the TSS, use `width = 200001` (20kb window + 1bp for the TSS itself).  
* As we want to have a window *around* the TSS we set the `fix = "center"`.  

<br>

### 3.3.3 Plot the average H3K4me3 signal around the TSS   
You can plot the average H3K4me3 signal over this window with the `plotMeta()` function:  

```{r plotmeta_example, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
plotMeta(mat = [ScoreMatrix_object], xcoord = c([start,end]), ...)
```  

* Use the `xcoord =` parameter to define relative base positions for the x-axis and set the TSS at base '0'.   
* `...` means that there are additional, optional arguments, some of which we will come back later on in the tutorial.   

<br>

> **Exercise 3b**: Plot the average H3K4me3 signal around the TSS with `plotMeta()`    

> * `scores_h3k4me3_tss` of exercise 3a is available.  
> * Note that we set `xcoord = c(-5000, 5000)` for you, as our window was 10kb.

### 3.3.4 Plot average H3K27ac signal     
Let's look at another promoter mark: does H3K27ac show the same shape and signal strength?  

### Exercise 4   

> **Exercise 4**: Generate a plot of the average H3K27ac signal in a **10kb** window around the TSS.  
>

         )
```

### 3.3.5 Multiple profiles in one plot  
We can observe differences and similarities between two ChIP-seq datasets with respect to their peak strength and peak shape better when we plot them in one plot. This can be achieved by generating a "ScoreMatrixList" object and providing that to the `plotMeta()` function:    

```{r example_scorematrixlist, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# 1. Generate a "ScoreMatrixList" object:   
ScoreMatrixList_object <- new("ScoreMatrixList",list([object1_name]=[ScoreMatrix_1], ..., [objectN_name]=[ScoreMatrix_N]))

# 2. Provide plotMeta with this "ScoreMatrixList":   
plotMeta(mat = ScoreMatrixList_object, 
         xcoord = c([start,end]),
         overlay = [TRUE/FALSE], 
         profile.names = [vector of names, used in the legend])
```

* The first argument in `new()` tells which type of object we want to make.  
* The second argument in `new()` is a list of ScoreMatrices with a custom name for each.  
* With `overlay=TRUE` the two density profiles are plotted in one plot.   
* With `overlay=FALSE` the two density profiles are plotted in separate plots with the same x- and y-axis limits and scales.  
* In `profile.names =` you can give a character vector of names, for every object in the ScoreMatrixList. These names will be used for the legend.   

### Exercise 5  

> **Exercise 5**: Complete the code below to generate one plot with the average signal profiles of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac in a 10kb window around the TSS.

### 3.3.6 Add H3K27me3 signal    
So far you have examined the average enrichment of ChIP marks with very narrow peaks. Let's add a mark that showed a 'broad' ChIP peaks in the genome browser: **H3K27me3**.

## 3.4 ChIP-seq signal vs. gene expression  
In this section you will investigate   

- the variation in H3K4me3 signal (as reads per million extracted from the bigWig file) in a defined window around the TSS;  
- and the relation between this signal and gene expression (as FPKM).   

### 3.4.1 Average H3K4me3 signal per gene expression quartile  
To investigate this relationship you will:  

a. Calculate the average H3K4me3 signal in a **5kb** window around the TSS.  
b. Convert the output of (a) in to a data.frame.  
c. Add the gene expression values for the corresponding genes to the data.frame.    
d. Group genes based on their gene expression in 4 quartiles and plot the H3K4me3 signal per group in a boxplot.  

### Exercise 7a  
To calculate the average H3K4me3 signal in a defined window around the TSS you can use a modified version of the `ScoreMatrix()` function you used in section 3.3: the `ScoreMatrixBin()` function.  As the name suggests, this function does not calculate the coverage for each bp in the given windows, but it will chop the windows into `n` number of **bins**. 

```{r scorematrixbincode, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ScoreMatrixBin(target = [path_to_bigwig_file], 
               windows = [GRanges_object_with_windows_of_interest], # 'windows' can also be called 'intervals' or 'regions'
               bin.num = n,
               type = "bigWig", 
               strand.aware = [TRUE/FALSE])
```

* The number of bins can be set with the `bin.num=` parameter. Setting this to  `bin.num=1`, will give the average signal for each window.   
* Side note: this function is also useful when working with windows of varying size like genes, in those cases we set `bin.num` to 50 or 100.  
<br>

> **Exercise 7a**: Calculate the average H3K4me3 signal in a window of 5kb around the TSS (code check).  
> 
> * `tss_chr19_sample` is the GRanges object with TSS locations for which we have signal in the bigWig files.  
> * Use `resize()` to resize the window in `tss_chr19_sample` to 5kb.  
> * `bw_h3k4me3` directs to the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq bigWig file.  

```{r q7a_signalfpkm, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE, error=TRUE}
# Re-size the window in "tss_chr19_sample" to 5001bp
tss_chr19_sample_window <- resize(x = ___, width = ___, fix = "center")

# Obtain the average H3K4me3 core for each window in "tss_chr19_sample_window"
average_h3k4me3_tss <- ____(target = bw_h3k4me3, 
                                             windows = ___, 
                                             bin.num = ___, 
                                             type = 'bigWig', strand.aware =TRUE)  
```

```{r q7a_signalfpkm-solution}
# Resize the window in "tss_chr_sample" to 5001bp
tss_chr19_sample_window <- resize(x = tss_chr19_sample, width = 5001, fix = "center")

# Obtain the average H3K4me3 core for each window in "tss_chr19_sample_window"
average_h3k4me3_tss <- ScoreMatrixBin(target = bw_h3k4me3, 
                                             windows = tss_chr19_sample_window, 
                                             bin.num = 1, 
                                             type = 'bigWig', strand.aware =TRUE)  
```

```{r q7a_signalfpkm-code-check}
#when I designed the tutorial, I saved this scorematrix object so that we do not need to rerun the function in coming questions but can directly load the output. 
#saveRDS(average_h3k4me3_tss, file = file.path("/home", "ctoenhake", "learnr.proto","inst", "extdata", "week3", "prepared_rds", "scorematrix_q6_average_scores_h3k4me3_tss_5kbwindow.rds"))

grade_code()
```

### Exercise 7b  
Next, transform the resulting 'ScoreMatrix' object to a data.frame to facilitate data manipulation with dplyr and plotting with ggplot2. You can transform:  

* a 'ScoreMatrix' to a basic matrix with: `matrix_object <- as([ScoreMatrix_object], "matrix")`  
* a matrix to data.frame with: `dataframe_object <- as.data.frame([matrix_object])`.    

> **Exercise 7b**: Transform the `average_h3k4me3_tss` to a data.frame.  
>
> * Use the  output of the `head()` argument to find the name of the variable with the H3K4me3 scores.   

```{r q7b_prepare}
# scores from ex 7a
average_h3k4me3_tss <- readRDS(file = system.file("extdata", "week3", "prepared_rds", "scorematrix_q7_average_scores_h3k4me3_tss_5kbwindow.rds", package = "learnr.proto"))
```

```{r q7b_signalvsfpkm, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE, error=TRUE, exercise.setup="q7b_prepare"}
# transform average_h3k4me3_tss into a matrix
scores_as_matrix <- as(___, "matrix")

# and the matrix into a data.frame 
average_h3k4me3_tss_df <- as.data.frame(___)

# Print the head of the resulting data.frame  
# What is the name of the variable with the H3K4me3 scores?  
head(__)
```

```{r q7b_signalvsfpkm-hint-1}
# Look at the description below the exercise to determine how to complete the code
```

```{r q7b_signalvsfpkm-hint-2}
# To transform average_h3k4me3_tss into a matrix you should use:
scores_as_matrix <- as(average_h3k4me3_tss, "matrix")
```

```{r q7b_signalvsfpkm-hint-3}
# To transform the matrix into a data.frame you should use: 
average_h3k4me3_tss_df <- as.data.frame(scores_as_matrix)
```

```{r q7b_signalvsfpkm-hint-4}
# And finally print the head of:
head(average_h3k4me3_tss_df)
```

<!-- ```{r q7b_signalvsfpkm-solution} -->
<!-- # transform average_h3k4me3_tss into a matrix -->
<!-- scores_as_matrix <- as(average_h3k4me3_tss, "matrix") -->

<!-- # and the matrix into a data.frame  -->
<!-- average_h3k4me3_tss_df <- as.data.frame(scores_as_matrix) -->

<!-- # Print the head of the resulting data.frame   -->
<!-- # What is the name of the variable with the H3K4me3 scores?   -->
<!-- head(average_h3k4me3_tss_df) -->
<!-- ``` -->

```{r q7b_signalvsfpkm-check}
grade_result(
  pass_if(~identical(.result, head(as.data.frame(as(average_h3k4me3_tss, "matrix"))))),
  correct = "V1 is not an informative variable name and we are lacking the corresponding geneID! In the code below we therefore renamed 'V1' and added the variable 'gene_id'."
)
```

1. Rename 'V1' to 'h3k4me3_rpm' using `dplyr::rename()`. We use `dplyr::rename` formulation because multiple packages have a `rename()` function, this way R knows we want to use the rename function from the dplyr package.  
```{r rename_example, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
average_h3k4me3_tss_df <- as.data.frame(as(average_h3k4me3_tss, "matrix")) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(h3k4me3_rpm = V1)
```

2. Copy the column 'gene_id' from the object `tss_chr19_sample` to our dataframe with average H3K4me3 scores. This is possible because these objects have the same row order.  
```{r addgeneid, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
average_h3k4me3_tss_df$gene_id <- tss_chr19_sample$gene_id
```
<br>
We visualize the range of average H3K4me3 scores in this 5kb window by running: 
```{r h3k4me3_boxplot_example, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(average_h3k4me3_tss_df) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(y = h3k4me3_rpm))+
  scale_x_discrete(labels=NULL)+ # remove labels from the x-axis, as we have one boxplot they are not informative
  theme_bw()
```

![](images/boxplot_average_h3k4me3_tss_5kbwindow.png){width=40%}\  
```{r h3k4me3_boxplot_example2, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3, fig.height=3.8}
# when I made the tutorial, I saved the figure. The code to make the boxplot is shown below, it is not run but the image from this chunk is shown. 
average_h3k4me3_tss <- readRDS(file = system.file("extdata", "week3", "prepared_rds", "scorematrix_q7_average_scores_h3k4me3_tss_5kbwindow.rds", package = "learnr.proto"))
average_h3k4me3_tss_df <- as.data.frame(as(average_h3k4me3_tss, "matrix")) 
average_h3k4me3_tss_df <- average_h3k4me3_tss_df %>% dplyr::rename(h3k4me3_rpm = V1)
average_h3k4me3_tss_df$gene_id <- tss_chr19_sample$gene_id

ggplot(average_h3k4me3_tss_df) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(y = h3k4me3_rpm))+
  scale_x_discrete(labels=NULL)+
  theme_bw()
#ggsave(filename= "images/boxplot_average_h3k4me3_tss_5kbwindow.png")
```

### Exercise 7c  

To generate this boxplot for groups of genes grouped by gene expression into 4 equally sized bins (quartiles), you need to:    

1. add the gene expression data to `average_h3k4me3_tss_df` and   
2. define a new categorical variable that groups genes into quartiles.  

#### Step 1. Adding gene expression values to `average_h3k4me3_tss_df`.  
The gene expression data are stored in the metadata of `tss_chr19_sample`:  
```{r show_tss_chr19_sample, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
show(tss_chr19_sample)
```

In exercise 7c you will add the variable 'FPKM' (fragments-per-kb-per-million) to `average_h3k4me3_tss_df`. 

#### Step 2. Defining a new categorical variable that groups genes into quartiles by gene expression.  
You can group rows of a data.frame into groups of equal size using `ntile()` from dplyr:  
```{r ntile_example, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ntile(x = [variable_to_use_for_grouping] , n = [number_of_groups])
```
By running `ntile()` within `mutate()` you can define the new variable. For example, below we categorize genes into either quartiles and quintiles based on their gene expression in `quantification_chr19_sample`:   
```{r ntile_example2, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# group genes in quartiles by FPKM
# count genes per group with group_by() and tally
quantification_chr19_sample %>% 
  mutate(group_in_quartiles = factor(ntile(x = FPKM , n = 4))) %>% 
  group_by( group_in_quartiles ) %>% 
  tally
# group genes in quintiles by FPKM   
# count genes per group with group_by() and tally
quantification_chr19_sample %>% 
  mutate(group_in_quintiles = factor(ntile(x = FPKM , n = 5))) %>% 
  group_by( group_in_quintiles ) %>%
  tally
```

* *Tip*: instead of printing the output of `mutate()` to the console, you can pipe it directly into ggplot2.   

> **Exercise 7c**:   
> 
1. Add FPKM values to `average_h3k4me3_tss_df`.  
2. Define a new categorical variable that groups genes into quartiles based on FPKM values.   
3. Plot the H3K4me3 signal (y-axis) for genes grouped by gene expression (FPKM) quantile (x-axis) in a boxplot using ggplot.  
* Pipe the output of (2) into the ggplot command of step (3).  
* Run your completed code and answer the multiple choice quetions below.

Observe that the association between H3K4me3 signal and gene expression is a **trend and not a 1-to-1 relationship!** Additional factors influence gene expression levels including the presence of other marks, the presence of TFs and post-transcriptional mechanisms.   
<br>

> #### **Optional**: Adding trend lines   
It can sometimes be hard to identify the trend based on points alone. In those cases we may wish to add a smoothening or *trend* line to the plot.

         allow_retry=TRUE
         )
```


## 3.5 Heatmaps  
### 3.5.1 Intermediate summary and introducing heatmaps   
In fg2 you observed that H3K4me3 peaks occur more often than expected at the promoter, that the presence of H3K4me3 and/or H3K27me3 at the promoter are associated with the gene's expression level; and that at a chromosome 19-wide scale\*, some combinations of marks co-occur more than others (\*this is also the case genome-wide).  
<br>
The average signal plots of [3.3 ChIP-seq signal strength] showed you that different histone marks have different *average* signals strengths and that this profile is, for some marks, directional suggesting a functional relationship with gene expression. These plots clearly visualized the *average* signal but did not tell you anything about the variation in signal strength nor did it show a relationship with gene expression measurements.     
<br>
Finally, in the box- and scatter plots of [3.4 ChIP-seq signal vs. gene expression] you observed that the ChIP-seq signal strength at the TSS can be associated with a gene's expression level although this is never a hard, 1-to-1 relationship.  
<br>

#### Introducing heatmaps of ChIP-seq data   
A method to summarize the (co-)occurrence ChIPped marks at a genomic feature like the TSS and signal strength, is a heatmap. In heatmaps of genomics data, each row represents an interval, often aligned at the genomic feature in the center The signal strength at each bp or within each bin is encoded by a color scale (eg. white for background signal, bright red for maximum signal).    
<br>
If we order this heatmap by the gene's expression level, it can visualize the relationship with gene expression, albeit in a crude manner.   
<br>
Importantly, by plotting heatmaps of different histone marks side-by-side, and then clustering the rows such that similarly marked regions are grouped together, we can identify patterns of histone mark co-occurences that occur more often or less often than others (eg H3K4me3 and H3K27ac co-occurrence at the TSS).  
<br>
You will start by making a heatmap of 1 mark: H3K4me3 signal at the TSS.  

### 3.5.2 Heatmap of 1 mark     
To make a heatmap of the H3K4me3 signal around the TSS, you can use the same ScoreMatrix as you used for the average signal plot in section [3.3.2 Importing ChIP-seq signal in r]. But this time, use the `heatMatrix()` function for plotting:   

```{r heatmatrix_example, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
heatMatrix(mat = [ScoreMatrix_object], 
           col = [vector_with_color_pallette], 
           xcoord = c([start,end]),
           legend.name="rpm", 
           winsorize=c(0,999),
           main=[custom_title],
           xlab=[custom_x-axis_label],
           .....)
```  

* The `xcoord =` parameter sets relative base positions for the x-axis and sets the TSS at position '0', same as for the `plotMeta()` function.    
* Use `col =` to define your own color palette. The default palette is a rainbow color scheme (blue-green-yellow-orange-red) but for the heatmaps we advise you to use a color palette from white-to-[color] to represent the background-to-maximum signal measured in these ChIPs.  
* with `legend.name=` you can define a label for the legend, we use 'rpm' as it stands for reads per million.  
* with `winsorize=` you can determine the upper and lower percentile values and limit the extreme values. Eg. `winsorize=c(0,99)` will limit the values to only the 99th percentile of the matrix, everything above this value will be equalized to the value of the 99th percentile. We will set this parameter to `c(0,999)` to limit the extreme outliers.  
* `...` means that there are additional, optional arguments, some of which we will come back to soon.   

> #### Background info: defining your color palette with `colorRampPalette()`  
> <details><summary>**Click here** if you want to learn more about how we made the color palettes for the heatmaps.</summary>   
> There are many R packages out there that help you generate color palettes (eg.. [RColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/#), [viridis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) and more see this [Comprehensive list of color palettes in r by Emil Hvitfeldt](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/r-color-palettes)). We worked with the `colorRampPalette()` function for the coming heatmaps.  
<br>
`colorRampPalette()` takes a vector of colors as input and returns a function that you can subsequently call using the argument `n=`. This function will return a palette with `n` entries extrapolating the vector of colors given to `colorRampPalette()`.   
<br>
> Here's an example of a red-to-blue palette with 4 colors applied to the boxplot of Exercise 7d (section [3.4.1 Average H3K4me3 signal per gene expression quartile]):   
<br>
Create palette function:
`palette_function <- colorRampPalette(c("red", "blue"))`  
<br>
Invoke palette_function to create a palette with 4 colors evenly spaced between red and blue:  
`my_palette <- palette_function(n=4)`     
<br>
Plot the boxplot of exercise 7d with these colors 
`expression_and_h3k4me3 %>%`    
  `mutate(gene_group = factor(ntile(FPKM, n=4))) %>%`   
  `ggplot(.)+`  
  `geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(x = gene_group, y = h3k4me3_rpm, fill = gene_group))+`  
  `scale_fill_manual(values = my_palette)+`  
  `theme_bw()+`  
  `labs(title = "Average H3K4me3 signal at TSS per gene group.",`  
        `subtitle = "5kb window around the TSS, gene groups by gene expression quantiles")`   
<br>
> ![](images/boxplot_average_h3k4me3_tss_5kbwindow_genegroup_withcolors.png){width=80%}\     
<br>
> Instead of creating the palette function, you can also define `n` immediately after calling `colorRampPalette()`, see the following example:   
`my_palette <- colorRampPalette(c('red', 'blue'))(4)`  
> <br>
> Using the above function we prepared the color palettes for H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27ac and H3K27me3:  
`colors_h3k4me3 <- colorRampPalette(c ("white", "red"))(100)`
`colors_h3k4me1 <- colorRampPalette(c ("white", "purple4"))(100)`
`colors_h3k27ac <- colorRampPalette(c ("white", "green4"))(100)`
`colors_h3k27me3 <- colorRampPalette(c ("white", "dodgerblue4"))(100)`

### Exercise 9  

>**Exercise 9**: Generate a heatmap of the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq signal in a 10kb window around the TSS on a white-to-red color scale.  
> 
> * `tss_chr19_sample` contains the TSSs of which we have data in the available bigWig files.  
> * Rembember that the TSSs are 1bp wide and should be resized.  
> * `bw_h3k4me3` points to the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq bigWig file.   
> * Review previous exercises (eg Exercise 5, section [3.3.5 Multiple profiles in one plot]) for how to resize your tss window and generate the ScoreMatrix object.  
> * We created a colorpalette for you using `colorRampPalette()`.   
> * In case you are interested in the effect of using for example a different window size, or different color settings, you can adjust the code accordingly but then hit "Run Code".    
> * **Coffee time**: Due to the file size, it may take 10-20 sec to run this plot.

### 3.5.4 Heatmap of 1 mark ordered by gene expression   
Instead of ordering the heatmap by the plotted signal, we can also order it by the expression of the corresponding gene. To do so, we need to provide an ordered object to the `windows =` parameter in the `ScoreMatrix()` function.  
<br>
To order (or '*sort*') a GRanges object, you use the `sort()` function:  
```{r sort_granges, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
sort(x = [GRanges_object], by = ~[variable_to_sort_on], decreasing =[TRUE/FALSE])
```

### Exercise 11  

>**Exercise 11**: Sort `tss_window` by high-to-low FPKM values using the `sort()` function. The resulting object `tss_window_sorted` will be used to make the heatmap.   
>
> * `tss_window` is the object you generated in [Exercise 9].

### 3.5.6 Heatmaps of multiple histone marks, ordered by gene expression.  
Using the heatmaps of exercise 11 and exercise 12 we can identify sets of regions covered by either H3K4me3 or H3K27me3, by both marks or by neither of the two. This is easier if we plot the heatmaps side-by-side. To do so is similar to making a profile plot of the average signal of multiple marks (see [3.3.5 Multiple profiles in one plot]).   
<br>
Start by  making a "ScoreMatrixList" object:    
```{r example_scorematrixlist_repeat, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# 1. Generate a "ScoreMatrixList" object:   
ScoreMatrixList_object <- new("ScoreMatrixList",list([object1_name]=[ScoreMatrix_1], ..., [objectN_name]=[ScoreMatrix_N]))
```
<br>
Then, provide the resulting "ScoreMatrixList" object to the `multiHeatMatrxi()` function:
```{r example_multiheatmatrix, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# 2. Plot multiple heatmaps side-by-side using scores from a "ScoreMatrixList" object.  
multiHeatMatrix(sml = [ScoreMatrixList_object],
                col = [list_or_vector_of_color_pallette(s)],
                xcoord = c([start,end]),
                legend.name="rpm",
                winsorize=c(0,999),
                order = TRUE/FALSE,  
                clustfun = [function_for_clustering_the_rows_in_sml],
                matrix.main=[vector_of_names_plotted_above_each_heatmap], # if left empty the names of the matrices in ScoreMatrixList are used
                xlab=[custom_x-axis_label],
                ....)
```

* `col=` can be given a single color palette as a vector or a list of color palettes. When a vector is provided, all individual heatmaps will get the same color scale. When a list is provided, the length must match the number of heatmaps plotted and will give each heatmap a different color scale.   
* With `order=TRUE` the matrix will be ordered based on the sum-per-row in descending order, default setting is `FALSE`.   
* In `clustfun =` you can provide a function to cluster the rows, this is optional.   

### Exercise 13

### 3.5.7 Clustering side-by-side heatmaps  
You can cluster the windows (=rows) in a heatmap such that windows with the same type and intensity of marking, are grouped together. For example regions with high H3K4me3 signal and no H3K27me3 signal could be a cluster. To cluster the heatmap you use the `clustfun=` parameter. Without going into detail of discussing different clustering methods (that would give us enough material for another tutorial), here is a basic template you can use for kmeans-clustering. k-means takes data points as input and groups them into k clusters.    
```{r kemansclustering, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
kmeans_function <- function(x) kmeans(x, centers = [k])$cluster
```

* `[k]` should be replaced by an integer value (eg 2,3,4,6 etc.) and determines the number of clusters that will be generated.  

### Exercise 14  

> **Exercise 14a**: Complete the code below to generate side-by-side heatmaps of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in a 10kb window around the TSS, clustered with kmeans clustering into 4 clusters (code check).

> * Hit "Submit answer" to submit the completed code for grading.

> **Exercise 14b**: Identify the following clusters in your side-by-side heatmap...    
<details><summary>Click here to open the drop-down box.</summary>  
Due to technical reasons the rows are clustered slightly different, every time you run this code. Also, you will get a slightly different clustering compared to your fellow students.   
<br>
Nevertheless, you will probably see two clusters with relatively high H3K4me3 signals, in the plot below these are **clusters 1 and 3**. They are put into distinct clusters because:   
>  
i. The scores across the window are clearly different. In cluster 1 the signal is concentrated around the TSS while in cluster 3 the signal is distributed more downstream the TSS.    
ii. We directed the function to make 4 clusters.   
>  
Observe as well that windows with high H3k27me3 signal cluster together, **cluster 4**. Several of them have signal around the TSS in the H3K4me3 heatmap as well. These are the candidate **bivalent promoters**. Because we down-sampled the data and because we set the number of clusters to be formed to 4, they are with too few to form a separate cluster.

Try to identify the following trends in the heatmap plotted below. Can you spot them in your own heatmap as well? No worries if your heatmap is not identical to the one below. Due to the nature of the clustering altgorithm it outputs a slightly different pattern each time you run the code. But although the outputs are not often 100% identical, they should be similar as they are based on the same data. There is a good chance that your clusters are numbered differently. Or, in ±10% of the runs, we observed that the regions with high H3K27me3 signal were split up in two seperate clusters and you may observe that. Nevertheless, you should still be able to discern the general trends.   
> 
i. The pattern of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac signals are much alike but compared to the H3K4me3 signal, H3K27ac is less high and is found at fewer TSSs. This is in line with the average signal plot of [Exercise 4].  
ii. Compared to the heatmap of Exercise 14b, H3K4me3 covered TSSs are now distributed over 3 clusters. Besides the H3K4me3 signal itself, clustering was influenced by the shape of the H3K4me1 signal: TSSs with relatively narrow H3K4me1 signal around the TSS (**cluster3**) are clustered separately from those with more broad H3K4me1 signal (**cluster 1**).   
iii. H3K27me3 covered TSSs remain grouped in one cluster in this heatmap (**cluster 4**) but, as mentioned, when rerunning the code we observed that in ±10% of the cases these regions were distributed over two clusters. Sidenote: this observation also means that we should have increased the number of clusters; there are apparantly more than 4 patterns in this dataset.

> Note that because we focus on a +/-5kb window  around the TSS, these heatmaps do not contain enhancer regions that are oustide this range.

## 3.6 Chromatin states   
### Introducing ChromHMM  
How would you annotate identified clusters in the example heatmap of Exercise 15c? Cluster 1, 3 and 4 are likely strong, weak and silenced promoters, respectively.   
<br>
If we would have had data of not only the TSS but of the whole gene and of H3K36me3 and H3K9me3, you would also be able to identify transcribed regions and regions repressed not by polycomb.     
<br>
This is where [ChromHMM](http://compbio.mit.edu/ChromHMM/) comes in play. "**ChromHMM is software for learning and characterizing chromatin states.**"   
<br>
Chromatin states are patterns of spatially re-occurring, co-localizing histone marks and (transcription) factors. that capture known genomic elements  such as promoters, enhancers, and transcribed, repressed, and repetitive regions, and can also capture novel classes or subclasses of elements (Adapted from [Ernst J & Kellis M., 2017 Nat prot](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2017.124)).  
<br>
ChromHMM learns the significant combinatorial and spatial patterns of chromatin marks de novo from the data. This reveals the functional elements without looking at the sequence.   

### Exercise 16  
ChromHMM analysis was also performed using the monocyte ChIP-seq data you have worked with and 90 other samples (ref: [BLUEPRINT secondary analysis](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/md/secondary_analysis). The following heatmap summarizes the identified spatial combinations of marks:  

- Each row corresponds to a different chromatin state.    
- Each column corresponds to a different mark.  
- The darker blue color corresponds to a greater probability of observing the corresponding mark in that state.

As you can see, some of the states have not (yet) been annotated (A-F). Which of the annotations in the table below is the correct one?  

State | Annotation 1 | Annotation 2 | Annotation 3 | Annotation 4    
:--:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:  
A | Repressed not by polycomb | Repressed by polycomb | Repressed by polycomb | Repressed by polycomb       
B | Repressed by polycomb | Repressed not by polycomb | Repressed not by polycomb | Repressed not by polycomb
C | Gene body | Inactive enhancer | Gene body | Gene body  
D | Active TSS | Active enhancer | Active enhancer | Inactive enhancer 
E | Active enhancer | Gene body |  Inactive enhancer | Active enhancer
F | Inactive enhancer | Active TSS | Active TSS | Active TSS  

<details><summary>***Click here for a hint***</summary> 

- Inactive enhancer is marked by H3K4me1 only.  
- Active enhancer has H3K4me1 and H3K27ac signal.  
- Active TSS has high H3K4me3 & H3K27Ac signal.  
- Gene body is marked by H3K36me3.  
- Repressed Polycomb should have H3K27me3 signal.  
- Repressed not by polycomb should have high H3K9me3 signal.

```{r q16_recognizing_patterns}
question("The likely annotation is ... ",
         answer("Annotation 1", message = "The 'Repressed not by polycomb' state is marked by H3K9me3 and the 'Repressed by polycomb' by H3K27me3 and not the other way around."),
         answer("Annotation 2", message = "C, D and E are not correctly annotated in this one."),
         answer("Annotation 3", message = "D and E should be swapped"),
         answer("Annotation 4", correct = T),
         allow_retry = TRUE)
```

## Finish  
> #### Congratulations!  
You have performed a quantitative analysis of the ChIP-seq signal at the TSS, analzyed its association with gene expression and the combinatorial patterns that occur among different histone marks at the TSS. You have completed this tutorial. Well done!
