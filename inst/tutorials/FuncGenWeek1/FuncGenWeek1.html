<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the computer practical for the <a href="https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/science/vm/osirislinks/bb/nwi-bb064b/">Functional Genomics 1</a> course. It builds upon R programming skills taught in the first year during <a href="https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/science/vm/osirislinks/bp/nwi-bp031/">Genomics and Big Data</a> and a basic understanding of the R programming language is required. We will also use statistics from the course <a href="https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/science/vm/osirislinks/bp/nwi-bp012c/">Statistics 1</a>.</p>
<p>The purpose of this practical is to teach you common bio-informatics analyses performed to analyse epigenomics data. You may already be familiar with the output of these analyses from scientific publications or lectures. We will focus on <strong>how to detect, quantify, annotate and visualise epigenetic marks</strong>. At the end of our analyses, we will also relate epigenetic markings to gene activity as well as candidate TFs that might establish them.</p>
<p>For this practical, we will use <strong>data of white blood cells</strong> from the <a href="http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/#/home">the BLUEPRINT project</a>, namely: monocytes, T cells, B cells and natural killer cells. We have chosen these datasets because they are well-documented and easy to find through the BLUEPRINT data portal, and not because we want to teach you the hematopoietic system.<br />

<!--Currently Illumina also has the nextSeq 500 series (besides MiSeq and HiSeq mentioned in the video). One of the main difference being that the MiSeq and HiSeq use four fluorescent colors (G = blue ,C = green, A = yellow and T = red) while the nextSeq series use 2-color chemistry (green and red). The effect being that with each cycle for the NextSeq, only two images need to be taken, As ar read as clusters appearing in both images and Gs are read as clusters that are not present in either of the two.-->
<p><br> The <strong>sequencer</strong> analyzes a set number of bases, eg 42, 50 or 100 bp, called a <strong>read</strong>. The resulting <strong>base calls</strong> and their <strong>quality scores</strong> are stored in <strong>fastq files</strong> which have the .fq or .fastq extension (or compressed as .fq.gz or .fastq.gz). These are always organized in the same manner with 4 lines per read. This is an example with 2 DNA sequences (8 lines):<br />

<p><br> Before we can start our data analysis and identify for example regions marked by activating and repressing histone marks, we need to process the raw data. This includes cleaning up, mapping, visualizing the sequenced reads and identifying genomic regions where reads tend to pile up (in other words “peaks”). Which is what we will discuss next.<br />

<h3>1.3.1 Post-sequencer processing</h3>
<p>The sequencer determines the sequence of the DNA molecules in your sample and produces massive amounts of data. In an ideal world, these data would 100% reflect reality. But….. It doesn’t and it is often your or a bio-informaticians task to discriminate valuable signal from artefacts and noise, the latter being accumulations of reads in regions that don’t actually contain binding sites of the protein or mofidified histone of interest.<br />
<br> <img src="images/wk1_3_intro_whatbioinformaticiancsdo.png" style="width:60.0%" /> <br />
<br> A general analysis workflow for ChIP sequencing data involves the steps discussed below. In theory, all of them can be performed in R but the first steps are commonly performed by tools outside R (often on Linux server). The resulting peakfiles, files with read depth and/or read counts are then imported in R.<br />

<p><br> Here we will discuss the steps that are necessary to turn the raw before we can start our analyses in R:<br />
<br></p>
<div id="section-run-a-quality-check-on-the-raw-data" class="section level4">
<h4>1. Run a quality check on the raw data</h4>
<p>We run the raw fastq files through <a href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">FASTQC</a> software to get a quick impression of whether our data has any technical problems of which we should be aware before doing any further analysis. This tools outputs a HTML report with graphs and tables summarizing, among others the base call accuracy, library base composition, duplication levels and the presence of overrepresented sequences.</p>
<p>The <strong>Per base sequence quality</strong> plot is one of the most important plots generated. It summarizes the base call accuracy (Y-axis) for each cycle (X-axis) across the library. See this example:<br />
<br> <img src="images/wk1_3_fastqc_per_base_quality_vb1.png" style="width:80.0%" /></p>
<p>This exmaple shows the average Phred quality for a library sequenced to 72 bp. The majority of bases have a good quality, the quality drops for the last two bases and we should (in this case) remove these from the end of the read.</p>
<p>For most runs, quality should be good for most reads through the whole run. If quality is low, we can use the other plots and tables to try to understand why this is.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good (Illumina) quality is generally Phred &gt; 28 - 30<br />
</li>
<li>Concerning (Illumina) quality is Phred &lt; 20</li>
</ul>
<p>If the QC does not support major technical problems like a systematic base bias that occured during sequencing or contamination during sample prep with foreign DNA, we can continue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong><br />
Use the following two FASTQC reports to answer the following questions.</p>

<h4>2. Trim and quality-filter reads</h4>

<li>Remove reads composed solely of adapters without insert.<br />
</li>
<li>Remove reads with an overall low-quality.<br />
</li>
<li>Remove or mask low-quality bases within predominantly high quality reads (if these occur, they are often the last one or two bases for Illumina sequencing). This can result in the complete removal of some reads because of their overall low quality or short length.</li>

<div id="section-align-reads-to-the-genome" class="section level4">
<h4>3. Align reads to the genome</h4>
<p>Next Generation Sequence (NGS) alignment means that we identify the likely location in the reference genome where the original DNA molecule came from. This process is called <strong>aligning</strong> and is performed by <strong>alignment tools</strong>, also called <strong>read mappers</strong>. Well known examples include STAR, BWA and bowtie2. In essence, these tools perform the same tasks but with different algorithms/strategies.<br />
<br> Since the publication of the human genome, successive versions have been released (also called <strong>assemblies</strong> or <strong>builds</strong>). The improvements in quality are thanks to technological advancements as well as improvements in the representativeness of the genome with respect to the genetic diversity found in the human population. We will work with (one of) the latests relaese referred to as <strong>GRCh38</strong> or <strong>hg38</strong> (Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 38).<br />
<br> The aligner thus requires as input the quality-filtered and trimmed fastq files together with the reference genome.<br />
<br> The outputted alignment is stored in (<em>huge!</em> ) TAB-delimited text Sequence Alignment Map files, <strong>SAM files</strong>. The compressed version of SAM files are called <strong>BAM files</strong> (Binary Alginment Map).<br />
<br></p>
<details>

</summary>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Background</em>: The SAM/BAM files contains a header with information about the mapping procedure. This is followed by the read alignments with 1 line per read. The latter contains information about the read sequence, how much of it was mapped to the reference genome (eg. the whole read or only part of it), how well it alinged, and lots of other information, dependent on the aligner.<br />
<br> To give you a feel for how SAM files looks like, here’s an example of the header and one record:<br />

<h4>4. Filter artefacts and reads aligning to multiple regions</h4>
<p>From the initial alignment we often identify and remove PCR artefacts, reads aligning with a low mapping quality (column 5) and optionally remove reads aligning non-uniquely. These actions can be performed with various tools. Commonly used ones are <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/">SAMtools</a> and <a href="https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">Picard tools</a>. The input and output of these steps are both BAM files.<br />

<div id="section-visualize-read-depth" class="section level4">
<h4>5. Visualize read depth</h4>
Files are created that count how many reads align to each nucleotide in the reference genome. Nucleotides with a relative high score pinpoint the likely locations of the ChIPped factor or histone PTM; to a region of accessible chromatin in ATAC-seq; or to the region that was likely transcribed and detected in RNA-seq.<br />
<br> These files can be uploaded to the UCSC Genome Browser which we will look at in more detail today as well. Various file types can store this kind of data. We wil use bigwig files (.bw file extension), these are fast and relatively small but we can’t view them.<br />

<div id="section-call-peaks" class="section level4">
<h4>6. Call peaks</h4>
<p>Reads are scattered through the genome but locations where the used antibody recognizes its target (eg. DNA-binding TF, histone, histone variant or histone PTM) will collect more reads. <strong>Peak calling</strong> is the computational process to identify these regions, often with respect to a control dataset where no antibody or no specific antibody was used, resp. <strong>input control</strong> and <strong>IgG control</strong> . A commonly used tool for this step is <a href="10.1186/gb-2008-9-9-r137">MACS2</a>. MACS2 was also used to call peaks in the datasets that we will be using.<br />
<br> Peak calling is a statistical procedure and never black and white. It depends among others on thresholds used (p-value, false-discovery rate) and the control sample. It is always wise to visually inspect the resulting peaks in the UCSC genome browser. If the called peaks do not correspond to the sites with high read coverage, you may need to adjust the settings for peak calling.<br />
<br> Peaks are repored as regions, or <strong>genomic intervals</strong> with their genomic coordinates: <strong>chr start end</strong>. As well as a <strong>score</strong> that indicates the strength of the signal observed for this peak. We will look at these files more closesly in week 2.<br />
<br></p>
</div>
<div id="section-read-counting" class="section level4">
<h4>7. Read counting</h4>
<p>Count reads that fall within genes, other genomic elements or peak regions. These counts and the actual peak locations are used for eg. differential gene expression analyses in RNA-seq or differential TF-binding in ChIP-seq (comparing differentiated vs undifferentiated or control vs treatment). A well-known, widely used tool for this purpose is DESeq2.<br />
<br> Sample clustering can be included here as additional QC. It should identify which samples are closely related and if they don’t, this might point to a label swap or more severe issue like not-working stimulus in one of the replicates.<br />
<br> Here’s an example of such a clustering, showing how different each sample is. Samples 15754-56 should be moslty similar and different from 15757-59, and vice versa:<br />

<h4 id="section-optionally-dnasei-footprinting-variant-calling-novel-gene-identification-and-more">8. Optionally: DNaseI footprinting, variant calling, novel gene identification and more</h4>
<p>Depending on your experimental set up additional steps are performed outside R. For DNaseI-seq, we can identify small depleted regions within peaks that correspond to the nucleotides that interact with the TF. This interaction protects these nucleotides from DNaseI attacks. These so-called footprints can be used to identify TF motifs and predict the likely TF bound. Although this sounds simple, and for a stable binding factor like CTCF it may be the case, it is not always that simple in reality.</p>

<h3>1.3.2 Common causes of noise and artefacts</h3>
<p>Artefact and noise in your data can arise from various causes. Here’s a list of common <strong>causes</strong>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Synthetic DNA sequences<br />
</li>
<li>Poor base call accuracy<br />
</li>
<li>Amplification bias during library preparation<br />
</li>
<li>Genomic repeats and Low complexity regions</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>: Below is a list of descriptions and methods to handle these arefacts. Read these carefully and combine what you think is the most likely description and method to handle the above mentioned artefacts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Descriptions</strong>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>The amount of nucleic acids you generally obtain from your cells is often too low to be directly analyzed and one or more steps of PCR are needed (unless you use special, amplification-free protocols and sequencing methods). Not all DNA or RNA molecules behave the same in this reaction. Some are amplified more than others.<br />
</li>
<li>These include adapters ligated to the DNA molecules to allow their amplification with uniform primers during library prep and in the sequencer. These adapter sequences come with the kit or are designed by the researcher self.<br />
</li>
<li>Short tandem repeats and interspersed repeats make up roughly 50% of the human genome. Reads produced by sequencers are generally shorter than these sequences, thus mapping them becomes ambiguous.</li>
<li>The chemical reaction and quality of the optical measurement that occur in the sequencer are not perfect and depend among others on the nucleotide composition of all samples, the length of the DNA molecules and the concentration of the samples. Each nt is therefore given a quality score that reflects the accuracy of the measurement.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Methods</strong>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>We can control for this by using the input sample as the control during peak calling, paired-end sequencing and remove all fragments with exactly the same coordinates for read 1 and read 2, and/or the use of a unique molecular identifier (UMI) appended to our adapters that labels each DNA fragment uniquely.<br />
</li>
<li>There are usually 3 choices: (1) Discard them; (2) Take the best alignment, if there are multiple best hits take one randomly; (3) Report all alignments or report up to a certain number. The strategy you choose depends on the sample, the technology, your research question and the reference species you work with.<br />
</li>
<li>Filter these out of our dataset right after we get our data from the sequencer.<br />
</li>
<li>Remove low-quality nt’s from reads or remove reads altoghether if all their nt’s are of low quality.</li>

- **Amplification bias during the library preparation:** The amount of nucleic acids you generally obtain from your cells is often too low to be directly analyzed and one or more steps of PCR are needed (unless you use special, amplification-free protocols and sequencing methods). Not all DNA or RNA molecules behave the same in this reaction. Some are amplified more than others and this can generate a bias. We can control for amplification bias with:  
  
  + Use input sample, for example as control in peak calling  
  + Paired-end sequencing 
  + Add a Unique Molecular Identifier, UMI, to the barcodes, to 

  
- **Synthetic DNA sequence:** These include adapters ligated to the DNA molecules to allow their amplification with uniform primers during library prep and in the sequencer. These adapter sequences come with the kit or are designed by the researcher self. Whether they are custom or commercial, they should be removed because they were not part of the original DNA or RNA material.    
- **Base call accuracy:** The chemical reaction and quality of the optical measurement that occur in the sequencer are not perfect and depend among others on the nucleotide composition of all samples, the length of the DNA molecules and the concentration of the samples. Each nt is therefore given a quality score that reflects the accuracy of the measurement or base call accuracyas it is also called.  
- Lastly, when trying to pinpoint the location in the reference genome where the DNA mo lececule most likely was derived off, we are confronted with:  
  
  * **Genomic repeats.** The origin of reads coming from these reigons is difficult to pinpoint. But also, the reference genome might contain more or less number of repeats than the original sample.  
  * **Low complexity regions**. These are regions that contain a lot of sequence similarity, eg telomeres. Because of this the quality of the reference genome is generally low in these regions. -->

<li><p><strong>Findable</strong>: The first thing to be in place to make data reusable is the possibility to find them. It should be easy to find the data and the metadata for both humans and computers. Automatic and reliable discovery of datasets and services depends on machine-readable persistent identifiers and metadata.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accessible</strong>: The (meta)data should be retrievable by their identifier using a standardized and open communications protocol, possibly including authentication and authorisation. Also, metadata should be available even when the data are no longer available.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interoperable</strong>: The data should be able to be combined with and used with other data or tools. The format of the data should therefore be open and interpretable for various tools, including other data records. The concept of interoperability applies both at the data and metadata level. For instance, the (meta)data should use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Re-usable</strong>: Ultimately, FAIR aims at optimizing the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings. Also, the reuse of the (meta)data should be stated with (a) clear and accessible license(s).</p></li>

<h3>1.4.1 UCSC Genome browser intro</h3>
<p>Genome browsers are great tools to display genomics data. You can walk, or <strong>browse</strong>, through all chromosomes, look at the location of genes, extract DNA sequences, examine pre-loaded data or upload your own data. The latter comes in quite handy when you want to, for example, have a visual (personal) confirmation of data quality, evaluate the effect of different settings for processing the raw reads, and/or confirm as computationally detected associations.<br />
<br></p>
<p>Watch the following youtube video’s to get familiar with the UCSC Genome Browser:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>UCSC Genome Browser Basics (duration: 08.40): <img src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNXI-M9oQl8" /><br />

<li>UCSC Genome Browser Tracks (duration: 09.14): <img src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kpy5G_MSG8" /></li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Checklist</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watching video 1 you should be able to:
<ul>
<li>Access your genome &amp; assembly of interest in the UCSC Genome Browser.<br />
</li>
<li>Find the chromosomal coordinates of the region currently in view or of a region you just selected (with click+drag).<br />
</li>
<li>Go to a gene or region of interest.<br />
</li>
<li>Zoom in and out.<br />
</li>
<li>Recognize UTRs, exons, introns, and the direction of transcription.<br />
</li>
<li>Find the length of a region or gene.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>After watching video 2 you should be able to:
<ul>
<li>Define what we mean with a track.<br />
</li>
<li>Adjust the display of tracks: eg. full, pack, hide etc.<br />
</li>
<li>Display tracks from the list of preloaded tracks below the browser (important: hit <code>refresh</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br> Additional important actions and terms that were not explicitly discussed in the videos:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Selecting a region in the genome browser</strong>: hold shift-key and click/drag with your left mouse key over the region. A pop-up appears to ‘Zoom in’, ‘Add highlight’ or ‘Cancel’ (cancel = do nothing).<br />
<img src="images/wk1_4_gb_drag_and_select.png" style="width:60.0%" /></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upstream</strong> and <strong>downstream</strong> refer to a position relative to the coding strand of a gene. Upstream means to the 5’ end and beyond. Downstream means to the 3’ end and beyond. Thus, depending on the orientation of the gene, upstream can mean that you move in the direction of the start of the chromosome or to the end of the chromosome.<br />

<p><strong>Yes! Finally time for some real data! Using the UCSC Genome Browser, you will inspect characteristic histone PTM and DNaseI-seq combinations, what their location in relation to genes and - ultimately - what this may say about the gene’s transcription state.</strong></p>
<p><br> To upload the data we have already put them together in a so-called track hub, hosted by our own server. We can add this to our browser session by going to the tab “My Data” in the top menu and select “Track Hubs”. In the “My hubs” tab you can paste a URL that points to the location of data you want to upload.<br />

<p><em>Background</em>: CD14 and CD16 are cell surface markers of the <strong>CD (Cluster of Differentiation) gene family</strong> which we will come across more often during this practical. These cell surface molecules and their differential expression are used for immunophenotyping of cells. CD molecules can function as receptors, ligands and, for example, activate signalling cascades, mediate cell adhesion, cell migration, regulate gene expression etc. <a href="https://www.genenames.org/data/genegroup/#!/group/471">HUGO, genegoups, CD</a></p>

<p>** Up to now we have inspected individual genes or domains. Can we quantify the observed associations? Eg. “<em>How many of the H3K4me3 peaks are located at promoters?</em>” And, “<em>is this signal statistically enriched in promoters?</em>”. Or “<em>Which and how often do marks co-occur genome-wide?</em>” Next week we will use coding in R to quantitatively describe these relationships.**</p>
